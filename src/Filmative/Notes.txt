*Make it so users can only review a movie once.  If the value of their review is not null then it shows the review and eventually you can replace an old review (or maybe add a rewatch option)

* User enters movie title, it queries the database to see if it's there, if so over to the Details page

* If it isn't there, it queries the database, and returns the movie information, adding it to the database

* Allow users to see others' ratings

* Display a random smattering of 16(?) movies on the Movie List homepage

* Make Micro-Review information AJAX call(?)
